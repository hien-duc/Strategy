# Strategy Pattern Presentation Outline (5-10 minutes)

## 1. Introduction (1 minute)
- **Group Name**: [Your Group Name]
- **Pattern**: Strategy Pattern
- **Objective**: Demonstrate interchangeable algorithms in e-commerce discount system

## 2. Pattern Overview (2 minutes)

### What is the Strategy Pattern?
- **Definition**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable
- **Purpose**: Algorithm varies independently of clients that use it
- **Also known as**: Policy Pattern

### Real-World Analogy
- Navigation systems: Different route calculation strategies (fastest, shortest, scenic)
- Payment processing: Different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, bank transfer)
- Our example: E-commerce discount strategies

## 3. Pattern Structure (1.5 minutes)

### Components:
1. **Strategy Interface** (`DiscountStrategy`)
   - Defines contract for all algorithms
   - Methods: `calculateDiscount()`, `getDescription()`

2. **Concrete Strategies** (5 implementations)
   - `RegularCustomerDiscount` (0%)
   - `PremiumMemberDiscount` (10%)
   - `VipMemberDiscount` (20%)
   - `HolidayPromotionDiscount` (25%)
   - `BulkOrderDiscount` (conditional: 30% or 10%)

3. **Context Class** (`ShoppingCart`)
   - Maintains reference to current strategy
   - Delegates calculation to strategy
   - Allows runtime strategy switching

## 4. Code Walkthrough (3-4 minutes)

### Show Key Files:
1. **DiscountStrategy.java** - Interface definition
2. **PremiumMemberDiscount.java** - Concrete strategy example
3. **ShoppingCart.java** - Context class
4. **Main.java** - Demonstration

### Highlight Key Features:
- Runtime strategy switching
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy extensibility

### Live Demo:
- Run the application
- Show different discount calculations
- Demonstrate strategy switching
- Show interactive features

## 5. Advanced Features (1 minute)
- Dynamic strategy selection based on order amount
- Strategy comparison to find best discount
- Lambda expression support (Java 8+)
- Comprehensive testing

## 6. Benefits & Real-World Applications (1 minute)

### Benefits:
- **Flexibility**: Runtime algorithm switching
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new strategies
- **Maintainability**: Each strategy is independent
- **Testability**: Strategies can be tested in isolation

### Real-World Uses:
- Java's `Comparator` interface
- GUI layout managers
- Compression algorithms
- Game AI behavior systems

## 7. Conclusion (0.5 minutes)
- Strategy pattern provides elegant solution for algorithm selection
- Promotes clean, maintainable, and extensible code
- Essential pattern for modern software development

## Video Recording Tips:

### Screen Recording Setup:
1. **IDE View**: Show project structure in IDE
2. **Code Walkthrough**: Navigate through key files
3. **Console Demo**: Run the application and show output
4. **UML Diagram**: Show class relationships (optional)

### Presentation Flow:
1. Start with pattern explanation
2. Show UML/class structure
3. Walk through code implementation
4. Run live demonstration
5. Explain benefits and real-world usage

### Key Points to Emphasize:
- **Runtime flexibility** - strategies can be changed during execution
- **Open/Closed Principle** - open for extension, closed for modification
- **Real-world relevance** - commonly used in enterprise applications
- **Clean code** - eliminates complex conditional statements

### Demo Script:
```
"Let's see our Strategy pattern in action..."
[Run Main.java]
"Notice how we can switch between different discount strategies at runtime..."
[Show different discount calculations]
"The shopping cart doesn't need to know the details of each discount algorithm..."
[Explain the delegation to strategies]
```
